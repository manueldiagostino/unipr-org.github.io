# LiSA's structure

LiSA is written in [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) 11, and comes as a [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) 7.2 project. All public [releases]({{ site.baseurl }}/releases/) are published on [Maven](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.github.lisa-analyzer).
While it is possible to freely develop with any tool, it is advised to use an IDE that integrates with Gradle. You can learn more in our guide on [how to build LiSA]({{ site.baseurl }}/getting-started/building.md). For more information about how LiSA's projects are structured, visit [this page](projects.md).
